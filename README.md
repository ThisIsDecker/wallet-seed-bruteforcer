# wallet-seed-bruteforcer
This Python-based tool efficiently brute-forces 12-word seed phrases (mnemonics) for MetaMask and Phantom wallets. It leverages multithreading and proxy support to accelerate the discovery process. Upon finding a valid seed, the program saves wallet details (address, private key, and seed phrase) to found_wallets.txt
